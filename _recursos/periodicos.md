Movement and its many offshoots. The environmentalist group Earth First! was founded in 1980 on the idea that every life form and ecosystem has a right to live and flourish regardless of human interests. Shortly after, it began its flagship journal, Earth First! Divergent perspectives within the movement led to new publications such as Wild Earth, ALARM, and Live Wild or Die!, as well as rich ephemera including calls for action, pamphlets, and primers. The collection is compiled by Bron Taylor, who generously donated hard copies of the publications to the Rachel Carson Center. Ephemera is provided courtesy of Bron Taylor.

|The Journal of Population and Sustainability<br>[https://www.whpress.co.uk/JPS.html](https://www.whpress.co.uk/JPS.html)|The Journal of Population and Sustainability (JP&S) is the only interdisciplinary journal exploring all aspects of the relationship between human populations and environmental sustainability. hile encompassing the relationship between human demographic dynamics and environmental change, the journal's central concern is with the population–consumption–technology–environment nexus (PCTEN) more broadly. The JP&S is therefore interested in the exploration of how the absolute growth and spatial expansion of human populations, including the growth of populations of human ‘stuff’ (i.e., buildings, consumer goods, vehicles, crops, domesticated animals, etc.) are related to the core characteristics of the Anthropocene: the persistent and extensive human impact on different terrains, geophysical systems, ecosystems, and populations of other species. owever, the JP&S also considers the complex and uneven distribution of environmental impacts amongst human population groups. We therefore particularly welcome papers concerned with understanding how population dynamics and environmental change relate to inequalities of welfare, economic and political power, and access to technology. By the same token, papers considering the interactive influence of demographic, technological, social, political, cultural and behavioural factors on environmental impact and sustainability are also encouraged. Moreover, the journal also aims to be a forum for the discussion of conceptual, normative and ethical issues surrounding the idea of sustainability and human numbers.|
|Sustainability<br>[https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability)|Sustainability is an international, cross-disciplinary, scholarly, peer-reviewed and open access journal of environmental, cultural, economic, and social sustainability of human beings.|

This growth reflects the urgency of debate and the pace and scale of change with respect to the water crisis, deforestation, biodiversity loss, the looming energy crisis, nascent resource wars, environmental refugees, climate change, and environmental justice, which are just some of the many compelling challenges facing society today and in the future. It also reflects the richness and insights of scholarship exploring diverse cultural forms, social phenomena, and political-economic formations in which society and nature are intricately intertwined, if not indistinguishable. As a forum to address these issues, we are delighted to present an important peer-reviewed annual: Environment and Society: Advances in Research. Through this journal we hope to stimulate advanced research and action on these and other critical issues and encourage international communication and exchange among all relevant disciplines.|
